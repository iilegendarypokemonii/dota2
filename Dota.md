# Dota 2 ward spots
A collection of screenshots of good wardplacements in patch 7.33c, made in june 2023.

## Radiant team wards
For when you are playing as radiant. Mostly covers offensive wards, but also some defensive ones for in the laning stage.
### Part 1. Laning stage (<10 min)
1. Above dire top tier 1 tower![1](https://i.postimg.cc/4xGvwPMq/01.png)
*Lets you dive the dire top tier 1 tower and shows the easy camp. Good for when the carry retreats to the jungle*

2. Top highground jungle between tier 1 and 2
![2](https://i.postimg.cc/nLc4fzn1/02.png)
*Shows the entrance to the highground jungle the safelane carry might take. When switching between the mines and this jungle. Also covers couriers for during the laning phase and shows people walking to the easy camp if placed right*

3. Dire mines
![3](https://i.postimg.cc/k4LKSvKj/03.png)
*Covers 2 camps from the mines outside of sentry range from the cliff*

4. Top river rune
![4](https://i.postimg.cc/7h77nJNq/04.png)
*Covers the top rune and the highground jungle entrance. Should spot all mid rotations to top*

5. Bottom bounty rune and bottom lane entrance
![5](https://i.postimg.cc/h479BNRN/05.png)
*Shows the bounty rune and covers a mid gank. The hill ward doesn't see the bounty and gets dewarded easily. Use this ward to countergank the mid laner when he shows up*

### Part 2. Mid game (after tier 1 tower dies)
1. Dire roshan entrance and lotus pool
![6](https://i.postimg.cc/jd0ydvs2/06.png)
*Covers the roshan entrance (without portal) and the lotus pool. Easy to place for carries shoving the wave*

2. Dire highground jungle bottom side and river
![7](https://i.postimg.cc/15Gwg6tH/07.png)*Very easy to place from the lowground. Can be placed outside the camp spawn. When placing it around 6 minutes, it shows a mid gank as well*

3. Dire highground jungle outpost
![8](https://i.postimg.cc/3Rk2Wc44/08.png)
*On top of the dire outpost. Outside of the cliff ward sentry. If you have control over it, allows you to safely tp here and see if the enemy wants to take it back*

4. Dire mid tier 1 highground jungle entrance
![9](https://i.postimg.cc/4yr7K4Cj/09.png)*Highground jungle ward barely outside of sentry range from the cliff*

5. Dire top tier 2 tower and mines entrance
![10](https://i.postimg.cc/Bt9bShH0/10.png)*Good for a tier 2 top push, and covers the entrance to the mines*

6. Dire mid lane and highground jungle entrances
![11](https://i.postimg.cc/gj6rP9ws/11.png)
*Shows heroes leaving base from the middle lane and shows you when a support tries to ward the ward cliff*

7. Dire mid tier 2 tower and triangle ancients entrance
![12](https://i.postimg.cc/wTmRCNLz/12.png)
*Just outside of the sentry range from the cliff. Partly covers the mid tier 2 tower and the triangle ancients*

8. Dire triangle secret shop
![13](https://i.postimg.cc/fTmjxpHY/13.png)*Shows the ancients and all entrances to this area. This is the most efficient farming spot for battlefury carriers. Also shows couriers flying to the secret shop. After seeing it buy an item, look at the direction of its flight to find a hero*

9. Dire bottom tier 2 tower and wisdom rune
![14](https://i.postimg.cc/130ntZvY/14.png)*Great for pushing the tier 2 and for wisdom rune timings. Allows for smoking to the tormentor at 20 minutes to steal it*

10. Dire roshan portal
![15](https://i.postimg.cc/1RLrVsK9/15.png)
*Obvious ward, but very important for roshan. Place just under the portal for vision over the outpost*

### Part 3. Highground
1. Above dire top tier 3 tower![16](https://i.postimg.cc/Bvq8PwyZ/16.png)
*Needs a smoke, but gives a lot of vision reaching behind the barracks*

3. Above dire top tier 3 tower and mines corner camp
![17](https://i.postimg.cc/bYGRvskC/17.png)
*Can be placed from behind the trees without a smoke*

4. Under dire bottom tier 3 tower
![18](https://i.postimg.cc/V6vdD0m3/18.png)
*Needs a smoke and requires you to walk between a set of trees. Autopathing messes up this ward if you're not careful*
